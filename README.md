# US political polls data analysis

I used PostgreSQL to create and load data, and analyse data particularly using subqueries, for the 2016 US election.

The main finding from conducting this work was that generally, in modern times, the presidential candidate with the most money raised for their campaign, **tends to win**.
  - This is somewhat a misleading claim, given the lack of variables I looked at. This is just to say that there is a correlation (subject to t-tests etc.).
